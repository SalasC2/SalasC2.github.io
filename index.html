	<p> This site is actually pretty good because it attracts the eye with it's elegance. Also the way the webpage scrolls allows for easier reading. Very easy for communication, simplistic and not to overwhelming. Something that could help is a bit more relevant images. But for it's purposes to get a reader to read, it does it's job! </p>

			<STRONG>How about now?  </STRONG> Can you click yes now?  <br> 
				<INPUT TYPE="checkbox"  VALUE="y"> Thanks Candice!! Now you can click submit <br> 
				<INPUT TYPE="checkbox"  VALUE="n"> Still nothing? Uhh, don't hit even bother hitting submit. <br>
